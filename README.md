## Design and Realization of Wireless Measurement System for Resistive Sensors
### Objectives
1. Measuring the resistance of a sensor of any given range from 200K - 6M.
2. Displaying the data through an OLED.
3. Transmitting the acquired data to a remote station.
4. Monitoring the resistance in real-time.
5. Recording the measured data.
